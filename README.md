# onBoard

What happens when Facebook meets GlassDoor?

onBoard is a social networking app that allows users to create a Room, and then view others members in that room who might they might be able to network with.

You can also ask general questions about the interview at a specific company, and hear what your fellow "Roommates" have to say about it.

onBoard was built with React on the front end, and a Rails API on the back end.
